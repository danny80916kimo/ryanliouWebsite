## Introduce

My name is Ryan, an iOS Developer. I work at Wondercise an online fitness platform company. My major mission is to develop the Wondercise app that deploys on iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS. Our product is an online fitness training platform. It provides a stable online streaming service that can serve coaches and users for workout exercises.

## Techniques

We use several techniques including WebSocket, APIs, Bluetooth communications, Agora Live Streaming Services, AgoraRTC, and AgoraRTM services. We collect the data from fitness watches like the Apple watch, and Garmin watches and our own fitness devices like the Wondercise Tracker and Wondercise Timeless band using Bluetooth, and compare those data with our users' data to calculate the score and synchronize the result through WebSocket.

## Team Working and Remote Working

I'm a remote worker in this company and we are developing our products by adapting Scrum for 2.5 years. To work remotely in a scrum team is not an easy job especially when others are working in an office. Communication is the key value of working together. We use JIRA and Figma jam to setup meeting and track our works.

## Coding Style and Review

Our development is firm and well-detailed. Before integrating the feature, we have to establish the Design Workshop to seal what we gonna develop and draw the UML diagram first. Then we use several automation tools to generate the basic codebase.  The benefit of using these tools is that it can ensure our implementation in Android and iOS  more similar and trackable. We also demand ourselves to use well-structured comments and formats to ensure the readability and clarity of our codebase. We also have a strict code reviewing culture to ensure our coding style is consist and keeping our.code sustain in a high readability and clarity form.
